      <h1>Know Your Limits</h1>
      <p>
        At KOA BETS, we want our members to enjoy playing their favorite games
        and gamble responsibly. However, for some, gambling can become a
        problem. Please familiarize yourself with the information below. It is
        essential if you are recovering from any kind of dependency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always establish limits for depositing and wagering before you start
        playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decide beforehand on a time limit for your playing session and stick to
        it. Within that session, ensure that you take regular breaks from
        playing.
      </p>
      <p>Never gamble if it interferes with your daily responsibilities.</p>
      <p>
        Never gamble if you are in recovery from any dependency or are under the
        influence of alcohol or any other substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never gamble if your primary aim is to recover losses. Remember, bet
        with your head, not over it.
